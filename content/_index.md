# websec practices
This page is a collection of websec practices. I am trying to describe 
what the problem is, and how to fix it using basic techniques, primarily 
provided by modern web browsers.

You find the practices under [websec practices](/post)

This is an open source project. You can contribute to it by forking and making 
a pull request. Repo on [Github](https://github.com/hakdo/sjefersuper)
